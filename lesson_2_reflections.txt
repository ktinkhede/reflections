What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, git start tracking that directory for version control and changes.
If we do not initialize git repository, gthen git will have no information about which directories to keep track of.
Obviously git cannot keep track of all the directories on system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area provides you a middlep latform, wherein you can make all the necessary arrangements,
bafore actually packing you changes into a commit.

It allowes you to choose which files should be included in a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Changes which we feel are part of one logical change, can be added to staging area from working directory.
Those changes that should not be part of the currently planned commit will still be present in working directory.
Since staging area contains only those changes which we have added to staging area, only those changes will be committed.
