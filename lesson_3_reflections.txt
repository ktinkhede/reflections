When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple people are collaborating on the same project
When we are ready to share our code with others.
When we want to publish our product
Its always better to have your repository in remote location, because your system migh crash at some point in time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

May be we are working on certain change in our local repository, and if at the same time git automatically pulls the changes from github,
our current work will be lost, and hence instead of pulling automatically, user is allowed to pull whenever needed.
